# Interview-Java-Programs
Java programs that might be asked in coding rounds or during a physical interview. Includes questions from LeetCode among other places.

1. ArrayListRemoveDuplicate - Code to remove duplicate elements from an array (arraylist) efficiently. Transfered elements to a hashset (linkedhashset), and transfered it back.

2. leet448 - Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array
        Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
        Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
        Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
        
3. leet136 - Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
